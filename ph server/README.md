**Eventify** is a full-featured web application built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) designed for efficient event management. It provides a seamless and intuitive user experience with a custom-built authentication system, dynamic event operations, and a robust search and filtering engine.

-----

## ‚ú® Key Features

  - **Custom User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system built from scratch using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and cookie-based sessions.
  - **Dynamic Event Management (CRUD):** Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete events with ease.
  - **Advanced Search and Filtering:** A powerful system allowing users to search events by title and filter them based on predefined date ranges (Today, This Week, Last Week, This Month, Last Month).
  - **Event Participation System:** Users can join events, which atomically increments the attendee count. A user is restricted to joining any single event only once.
  - **Personalized User Dashboard:** A dedicated "My Events" page where users can view and manage only the events they have created.
  - **Secure Private Routes:** Core application pages such as Events, Add Event, and My Events are protected and accessible only to authenticated users.
  - **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean, responsive, and performance-optimized interface designed for an excellent user experience.
  - **MVC Architecture:** The backend is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for maintainability and scalability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

  - Node.js (v18 or later)
  - npm or yarn
  - MongoDB (local installation or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/engrsakib/Event-Management.git
    cd Event-Management
    ```

2.  **Configure the Backend (Server):**

      - Navigate to the server directory:
        ```sh
        cd "ph server"
        ```
      - Install the required dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      - Create a `.env` file in the root of the `/ph server` directory and add the necessary environment variables (see the Environment Variables section below).
      - Start the backend server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

3.  **Configure the Frontend (Client):**

      - Navigate to the client directory from the root project folder:
        ```sh
        cd client 
        ```
      - Install the required dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
      - Create a `.env` file in the root of the `/client` directory and add the necessary environment variables.
      - Start the frontend development server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
